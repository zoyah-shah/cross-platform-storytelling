          What does a <span class="comma-punct" data-hover=",">comma</span> do.
          <br /><br />

          I have refused them so often and left the out so much and did without
          them so continually that I have come finally to be indifferent to
          them. I do not now care whether you put them in or not but for a long
          time I felt very definitely about them and would have nothing to do
          with them. <br /><br />

          As I say <span class="comma-punct" data-hover=",">commas</span> are
          servile and they have no life of their own, and their use is not a
          use, it is a way of replacing oneâ€™s own interest and I do decidedly
          like to like my own interest my own interest in what I am doing. A
          <span class="comma-punct" data-hover=",">comma</span> by helping you
          along holding your coat for you and putting on your shoes keeps you
          from living your life as actively as you should lead it and to me for
          many years and I still do feel that way about it only now I do not pay
          as much attention to them, the use of them was positively degrading.
          Let me tell you what I feel and what I mean and what I felt and what I
          meant.
