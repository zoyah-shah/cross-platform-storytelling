          Of these the one but the first and the most the completely most
          uninteresting is the
          <span class="question-mark" data-hover="?">question mark</span>. The
          question mark is alright when it is all alone when it is used as a
          brand on cattle or when it could be used in decoration but connected
          with writing it is completely entirely completely uninteresting. It is
          evident that is you ask a question you ask a question but anybody who
          can read at all knows when a question is a question as it is written
          in writing. Therefore I ask you therefore wherefore should one use the
          <span class="question-mark" data-hover="?">question mark</span>.
          Beside it does not in its form go with ordinary printing and so it
          pleases neither the eye nor the ear and it is therefore like a noun,
          just an unnecessary name of something. A question is a question,
          anybody can know that a question is a question and so why add to it
          the
          <span class="question-mark" data-hover="?">question mark</span> when
          it is already there when the question is already there in the writing.
          Therefore I never could bring myself to use a
          <span class="question-mark" data-hover="?">question mark</span>, I
          always found it positively revolting, and now very few do use it.
