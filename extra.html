        <p>
          When I was writing those long sentences of The Making of Americans,
          verbs active present verbs with long dependent adverbial clauses
          became a passion with me. I have told you that I recognize verbs and
          adverbs aided by prepositions and conjunctions with pronouns as
          possessing the whole of the active life of writing. <br /><br />

          Complications make eventually for simplicity and therefore I have
          always liked dependent adverbial clauses. I have like dependent
          adverbial clauses because of their variety of dependence and
          independence. You can see how loving the intensity of complication of
          these things that
          <span class="comma-punct" data-hover=",">commas</span> would be
          degrading. Why if you want the pleasure of concentrating on the final
          simplicity of excessive complication would you want any artificial aid
          to bring about that simplicity. Do you see now why I feel about that
          simplicity. Do you see now why I feel about the
          <span class="comma-punct" data-hover=",">comma</span> as I did and as
          I do. <br /><br />

          Think about anything you really like to do and you will see what I
          mean. <br /><br />

          When it gets really difficult you want to disentangle rather than to
          cut the knot, at least of anybody feels who is working with any
          thread, so anybody feels who is working with any tool so anybody feels
          who is writing any sentence or reading it after it has been written.
          And what does a
          <span class="comma-punct" data-hover=",">comma</span> do, a
          <span class="comma-punct" data-hover=",">comma</span> does nothing but
          make easy a thing that if you like it enough is easy enough without
          the <span class="comma-punct" data-hover=",">comma</span>. A long
          complicated sentence should force itself upon you, make you know
          yourself knowing it and the
          <span class="comma-punct" data-hover=",">comma</span>, well at the
          most a <span class="comma-punct" data-hover=",">comma</span> is a poor
          <span class="period-punct" data-hover=".">period</span> that lets you
          stop and take a breath but if you want to take a breath you ought to
          know yourself that you want to take a breath. It is not like stopping
          altogether has something to do with going on, but taking a breath well
          you are always taking a breath and why emphasize one breath rather
          than another breath. Anyway that is the way I felt about it and I felt
          that about it very very strongly. And so I almost never used a
          <span class="comma-punct" data-hover=",">comma</span>. The longer, the
          more complicated the sentence the greater the number of the same kinds
          of words I had following one after another, the more the very more I
          had of them the more I felt the passionate need of their taking care
          of themselves by themselves and not helping them, and thereby
          enfeebling them by putting in a
          <span class="comma-punct" data-hover=",">comma</span>. <br /><br />

          So that is the way I felt about punctuation in prose, in poetry it is
          a little different but more so and later I will go into that. But that
          is the way I felt about punctuation in prose.
