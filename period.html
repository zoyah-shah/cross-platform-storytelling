          But now dimly and definitely I do see that they might well possibly
          they might have in them something of the character of the
          <span class="period-punct" data-hover=".">period</span> and so it
          might have been an adventure to use them. I really do not think so. I
          think however lively they are or disguised they are they are
          definitely more
          <span class="comma-punct" data-hover=",">comma</span> than
          <span class="period-punct" data-hover=".">period</span> and so really
          I cannot regret not having used them. They are more powerful more
          imposing more pretentious than a
          <span class="comma-punct" data-hover=",">comma</span> but they are a
          <span class="comma-punct" data-hover=",">comma</span> all the same.
          They really have within them deeply within them fundamentally within
          them the <span class="comma-punct" data-hover=",">comma</span> nature.
          And now what does a
          <span class="comma-punct" data-hover=",">comma</span> do and what has
          it to do and why do I feel as I do about them.
