        <p>
          So now to come to the real question of punctuation,
          <span class="period-punct" data-hover=".">periods</span>,
          <span class="comma-punct" data-hover=",">commas</span>,
          <span class="colon-punct" data-hover=":">colons</span>,
          <span class="semicolon-punct" data-hover=";">semi-colons</span> and
          capitals and small letters. <br /><br />

          I have had a long and complicated life with all these. <br /><br />

          Let us begin with these I use the least first and these are
          <span class="colon-punct" data-hover=":">colons</span> and
          <span class="semicolon-punct" data-hover=";">semi-colons</span>, one
          might add to these
          <span class="comma-punct" data-hover=",">commas</span>. <br /><br />

          When I first began writing, I felt that writing should go on, I still
          do feel that it should go on but when I first began writing I was
          completely possessed by the necessity that writing should go on and on
          and if writing should go on what had
          <span class="colon-punct" data-hover=":">colons</span> and
          <span class="comma-punct" data-hover=",">commas</span> to do with it,
          what had <span class="period-punct" data-hover=".">periods</span> to
          do with it what had small letters and capitals to do with it to do
          with writing going on which was at that time the most profound need I
          had in connection with writing. What had
          <span class="colon-punct" data-hover=":">colons</span> and
          <span class="semicolon-punct" data-hover=";">semi-colons</span> to do
          with it what had
          <span class="comma-punct" data-hover=",">commas</span> to do with it
          what had <span class="period-punct" data-hover=".">periods</span> to
          do with it.
