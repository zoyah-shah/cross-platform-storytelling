        <p>
          You can see what an entirely different thing a period is from a
          <span class="comma-punct" data-hover=",">comma</span>, a
          <span class="colon-punct" data-hover=":">colon</span> or a
          <span class="semicolon-punct" data-hover=";">semi-colon</span>.
          <br /><br />

          There are two different way of thinking about
          <span class="colon-punct" data-hover=":">colons</span> and
          <span class="semicolon-punct" data-hover=";">semi-colons</span> you
          can think of them as
          <span class="comma-punct" data-hover=",">commas</span> and as such
          they are purely servile or you can think of them as
          <span class="period-punct" data-hover=".">periods</span> and then
          using them can make you feel adventurous I can see that one might feel
          about them as
          <span class="period-punct" data-hover=".">periods</span> but I myself
          never have, I began unfortunately to feel them as a
          <span class="comma-punct" data-hover=",">comma</span> and
          <span class="comma-punct" data-hover=",">commas</span> are servile
          they have no life of their own they are dependent upon use and
          convenience and they are put there just for practical purposes.
          <span class="semicolon-punct" data-hover=";">Semi-colons</span> and
          <span class="colon-punct" data-hover=":">colons</span> had for me from
          the first completely this character the character that a
          <span class="comma-punct" data-hover=",">comma</span> has and not the
          character that a period has and therefore and definitely I have never
          used them.
